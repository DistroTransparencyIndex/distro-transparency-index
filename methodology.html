        <h2>DTI Methodology</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The Distro Transparency Index (DTI) is a comprehensive evaluation system designed to assess the transparency of Linux distributions across various key aspects of their operations and governance.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Evaluation Criteria</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Governance Transparency</h4>
                    <p>This criterion evaluates the availability and detail of governance documents, the openness of decision-making processes, and the level of community involvement in governance.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Economic Transparency</h4>
                    <p>We assess the publication and accessibility of financial reports, budgets, and funding sources. This includes the regularity of financial disclosures and the ease of access to this information.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Code Accessibility and Development</h4>
                    <p>This criterion examines the accessibility of source code, the transparency of code review processes, and the level of community participation in the development process.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Scoring System</h3>
            <p>Each distribution is scored on a scale of 0-100, based on their performance across the evaluation criteria. The scoring is broken down as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Governance Transparency: 33.33%</li>
                <li>Economic Transparency: 33.33%</li>
                <li>Code Accessibility and Development: 33.33%</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Within each category, specific metrics are evaluated and contribute to the overall score for that category.</p>

            <h3>Data Collection</h3>
            <p>Our data is collected through a rigorous process that includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Thorough examination of public documents and official websites</li>
                <li>Analysis of community forums and discussion platforms</li>
                <li>Review of code repositories and development processes</li>
                <li>Direct communication with distribution maintainers when necessary</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We strive to ensure all data is current and accurately reflects the most recent state of each distribution.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Updating and Revision</h3>
            <p>The DTI is regularly updated to ensure its relevance and accuracy. We conduct full reviews of all distributions annually, with interim updates as significant changes occur.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Feedback and Contributions</h3>
            <p>We welcome feedback from the community and the distributions themselves. If you have information that could improve our assessment or notice any inaccuracies, please contact us.</p>
