        <section>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>NixOS, first released in 2003, is a unique Linux distribution built on top of the Nix package manager. Its governance structure is community-driven, overseen by the NixOS Foundation, a non-profit organization. The decision-making process involves core contributors and the wider community, with an emphasis on technical merit and consensus. NixOS follows a rolling release model, with stable versions released twice a year.</p>
            <p>The distribution is renowned for its innovative approach to package management and system configuration, using a purely functional model. Historically, NixOS emerged from academic research on creating reliable and reproducible system configurations. A key feature of NixOS is its ability to make system upgrades reliable and reversible, as well as supporting multiple versions of software side by side. The Nix package manager uses a declarative language, enabling atomic upgrades and rollbacks, reproducible states, and multi-user package management without conflicts.</p>
            <p>NixOS has been influential in promoting functional programming concepts in system administration and has inspired other projects like Guix. It is particularly popular among developers and researchers for its reproducibility features and the ability to create isolated development environments. Despite its power, NixOS has a steeper learning curve compared to traditional Linux distributions due to its unique approach.</p>
