            <h3>Concluding Analysis</h3>
            <p>openSUSE demonstrates a mixed level of transparency and accessibility across evaluated areas:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Excellent governance transparency with detailed guiding principles.</li>
                <li>Strong decision-making transparency through public board meetings.</li>
                <li>Excellent source code accessibility and community participation in development.</li>
                <li>Strong transparency in code review processes.</li>
                <li>However, there is a significant lack of economic transparency, with financial reports currently inaccessible.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Areas for significant improvement:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Restore accessibility to financial reports and improve economic transparency.</li>
                <li>Ensure consistent availability of important documentation during and after wiki migrations.</li>
                <li>Further development of a detailed, long-term public roadmap.</li>
                <li>Consider reducing the influence of commercial aspects (SUSE) on governance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The revised score of 73.53/100 reflects openSUSE's strengths in community involvement and development transparency, but also the significant impact of the current lack of economic transparency. This situation highlights the importance of maintaining consistent access to crucial information, even during infrastructure changes.</p>
            <p>openSUSE continues to demonstrate a commitment to open-source principles, but the recent inaccessibility of financial information presents a challenge to its overall transparency rating. We recommend that the openSUSE project prioritize restoring access to financial reports to improve its transparency score.</p>
