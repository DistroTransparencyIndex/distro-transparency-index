    <h3>Board Response and Updated Evaluation</h3>
    <p>The openSUSE board was contacted for clarification on the project's economic transparency. Doug, a board member, provided a comprehensive response, leading to a re-evaluation of certain aspects:</p>

    <h4>Previous Economic Evaluation:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Economic Transparency: 0/4</li>
        <li>Economic Accessibility: 0/4</li>
        <li>Overall Economic Score: üî¥ (Red)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Updated Economic Evaluation:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Economic Transparency: 2/4</li>
        <li>Economic Accessibility: 2/4</li>
        <li>Overall Economic Score: üü° (Yellow)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The improvement reflects our better understanding of openSUSE's unique economic structure, based on the board's explanation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The project operates primarily through contributions and donations of equipment, services, and support.</li>
        <li>Traditional financial reports are not applicable due to this structure.</li>
        <li>Information on sponsors is publicly available.</li>
        <li>The Geeko Foundation now provides a mechanism for managing certain funds.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While detailed financial reports are not available, this is due to the nature of the project rather than a lack of transparency. The board's willingness to provide a detailed explanation has positively impacted the evaluation.</p>
