        <h2>DTI Constitution: Fundamental Principles and Guidelines</h2>

        <p>The Distro Transparency Index (DTI) is founded on the following principles and guidelines:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Commitment to Transparency:</strong> The DTI is dedicated to promoting and evaluating transparency in Linux distributions. We hold ourselves to the same high standards of transparency that we evaluate in others.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Objectivity and Impartiality:</strong> All evaluations and rankings must be conducted objectively, based on clearly defined criteria. Personal biases or preferences must not influence the assessment process.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Open Methodology:</strong> The methodology used for evaluations must be fully disclosed and open to scrutiny. Any changes to the methodology must be publicly announced and justified.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Community Engagement:</strong> The DTI encourages and values community input. Feedback, suggestions, and constructive criticism from the Linux community will be actively sought and considered.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Regular Updates:</strong> The index will be updated regularly to ensure its relevance and accuracy. The frequency of updates will be clearly communicated.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Ethical Data Collection:</strong> All data used in evaluations must be collected ethically and legally, primarily from publicly available sources.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Right to Appeal:</strong> Distributions have the right to appeal their evaluation if they believe it to be inaccurate. A fair and transparent process for handling appeals will be established.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Non-Discrimination:</strong> The DTI will evaluate all Linux distributions equally, regardless of their size, popularity, or commercial backing.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Educational Focus:</strong> Beyond rankings, the DTI aims to educate the community about the importance of transparency in open-source projects.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Independence:</strong> The DTI will remain independent and not accept sponsorship or funding that could compromise its objectivity.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> The DTI commits to continuously improving its methodology and processes based on feedback and evolving best practices in open-source governance.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Respect for Privacy:</strong> While promoting transparency, the DTI respects the privacy of individuals involved in Linux distributions and will not seek or publish private information.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>These principles form the foundation of the Distro Transparency Index. Any future changes to these fundamental principles must be thoroughly discussed with the community and agreed upon by a consensus of DTI contributors.</p>
